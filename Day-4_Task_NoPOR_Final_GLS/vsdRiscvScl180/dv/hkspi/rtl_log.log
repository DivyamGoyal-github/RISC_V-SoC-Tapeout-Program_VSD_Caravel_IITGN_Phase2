Warning-[DEBUG_DEP] Option will be deprecated
  The option '-debug_all' will be deprecated in a future release.  Please use 
  '-debug_acc+all+dmptf -debug_region+cell+encrypt' instead.

Info: [VCS_SAVE_RESTORE_INFO] ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is detected on the machine. To enable $save functionality, ASLR will be switched off and simv re-executed.
Please use '-no_save' simv switch to avoid this.

The design hasn't changed and need not be recompiled. 
If you really want to, delete file /home/dgoyal/vsdRiscvScl180/dv/hkspi/simv.daidir/.vcs.timestamp and
run VCS again.

Warning-[VICIU] VCS initreg not enabled at compile time
  +vcs+initreg+ features will not work at runtime without +vcs+initreg+random 
  or +vcs+initreg+config option at compile time.
  Please recompile the design from scratch with one of the two switches to 
  avail the feature.
